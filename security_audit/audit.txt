Security Audit Report
Date: 2025-12-12 Target: 0x40-cloud Tools Used: Nuclei, Gosec, Trivy, npm audit

Executive Summary
The audit revealed critical and high severity vulnerabilities. The most significant risks include:

Path Traversal: Potential arbitrary file read/write in the backend file service.
Weak Secrets: Hardcoded, weak credentials and secrets in configuration.
Vulnerable Dependencies: severe issues in frontend libraries (xlsx).
Container Security: Application running as root in Docker.
Findings
1. High Severity
Vulnerable Dependency (Frontend): xlsx (CVE-2023-30533) - Prototype Pollution.
Integer Overflow (Backend): file_service.go:620-621 converting uint64 to int64 for disk stats.
Container as Root: Dockerfile does not specify a USER, running as root (Container Escape risk).
Hardcoded Secrets: 
.env
 contains weak/default passwords (e.g. DB_PASSWORD=bhop_dynasty, JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key...).
2. Medium Severity
Path Traversal Risk: file_service.go uses os.Open and os.Create with concatenated paths without sufficient sanitization verification (G304).
Insecure Permissions: Folders created with 0755 permissions (G301).
Docker Tag: Using alpine:latest instead of a pinned version.
3. Low Severity / Informational
Unhandled Errors: f.Close() errors unhandled in file_service.go.
Detailed Analysis
Backend (Gosec Analysis)
Path Traversal (G304): Detected in internal/services/file_service.go at lines 90, 158, 255. The application takes paths and opens them directly. If input validation is weak, this allows reading/writing arbitrary system files.
Integer Overflow (G115): stats.PhysicalTotal line 620. If disk size exceeds int64 max, negative values may be reported.
Frontend (npm audit)
xlsx: Has a high Severity prototype pollution vulnerability. Recommend updating or sanitizing input heavily if used for parsing untrusted Excel files.
js-yaml: Moderate severity prototype pollution.
Infrastructure (Trivy)
Dockerfile: Missing USER instruction.
Remediation: Add RUN adduser -D appuser && USER appuser to Dockerfile.
Dependencies: golang.org/x/crypto has SSH-related CVEs (CVE-2025-47914). Ensure the app does not expose SSH-like services.
